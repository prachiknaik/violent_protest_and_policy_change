 abstract = {Social scientists rarely take full advantage of the information available in their statistical results. As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently over-looked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors' own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

abstract = "Spatial autocorrelation is used to describe a particular form of spatial variation found in geographical data. Its presence is often indicative of something of interest in mapped data that requires explanation; may be used to tackle map interpolation problems; may raise statistical inferential problems because data are no longer independent. We discuss how spatial autocorrelation is measured and its presence is tested for; implications for spatial sampling, exploratory spatial data analysis, map interpolation, and confirmatory analysis including regression modeling."
